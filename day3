*************ARRAYS***********
1. Arrays are objects, which stores multible variables of same type.
2.Array length should be fixed
3.They are created during runtime
4. It comes under SEQUENTIAL ACCESS
5. It follows STATIC ALLOCATION
6. we can acces array elements by using index 


***********LINKEDLIST***********

1.It is both sequential and random
2.it follows DYNAMIC ALLOCATION
3. it can insert dynamically 
4.perform operations very easy



*************STACK********

1.SEQUENTIAL ACCESS
2.DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATED
3.FIRST IN LAST OUT


****************QUEUE************
1.SEQUENTIAL
2.DYNAMICALLY
3.FIRST IN FIRST OUT

**************Difference between static memory allocation and dynamic memory allocation***************

STATIC MEMORY ALLOCATION :

1. In static memory allocation, once the variables are allocated, they remain permanent.Static memory allocation is fixed
2.In SMA it is not possible to resize after initial allocation.
3.In static memory, allocation execution is faster than dynamic memory allocation.
4.In SMA, we cannot reuse the unused memory.

EXAMPLES OF STATIC  DATA STRUCTRES:

1.ARRAY


DYNAMIC MEMORY ALLOCATION:

1. Dynamic memory allocation is a method of allocating memory, and once the memory is allocated, it can be changed.
2.In DMA, the memory can be minimized or maximize accordingly.
3.In DMA  execution is slower than static memory allocation.
4.It allows reusing the memory even the programmer can allocate more memory whenever he  required  and also can release the memory whenever it  necessary.

EXAMPLE OF DMA:

1.LINKEDLIST
2.STACK
3.QUEUE
4.TREE
